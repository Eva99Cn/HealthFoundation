This is a letter from Jason , an American boy, to his French pen pal Guillaume

Dear Guillaume,

I was very pleased to get your letter. Apparently, you had a very good time
at Disneyland in Paris. I went to Disney World in Florida too but I didn't
enjoy it very much because there were too many people and the place is too big.
I preferred Miami, which is a fabulous city. I don't live very far from Miami,
and it's very pleasant, because the weather is very warm all the time and
there are a lot of orange trees. At the moment, it's Spring and they have
flowers, so it smells* very nice everywhere.

I invite you for the Summer holidays. If you come, I will be your guide;
we will visit the coast*, we will swim in the ocean, we'll go water-skiing,
you won't be bored!

If you arrive at the beginning of July, you will participate in the celebrations
of July 4th, Independence Day, which is our national day. Everybody wears blue,
white and red clothes, with stars, like on our flag*. You will have a good time.
There will be fireworks* in the evening. When you arrive at the airport, my
parents and I will be here to welcome you, so don't be afraid!

All my love,
Jason
